The project aims to build a simple and robust model to accuratly predict one's body fat percentage after inputing some necessary data.


## Data  
The data is in [data](https://github.com/JumpyJumpy/stat628-module2/tree/master/data) folder. It was collected by


## Code  
Codes are in [code](https://github.com/JumpyJumpy/stat628-module2/tree/master/code) folder. Codes used for cleaning the data and analysis were writen in R. Raw codes are in `BodyFat2.R`. See `BodyFat2.ipynb` for results of each step of data cleaning and analysis.   
Note: R package `tidyverse`, `car`, `ggplot2` and `MASS` are required to run `BodyFat2.R`.
